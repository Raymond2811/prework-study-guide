# prework-study-guide

A study guide for course pre-work

## Description

My motivation is simple, IÂ want to change my life for the better and I believe this is the right step towards that direction. I built this project so I can get a basic understanding of the upcoming topics and to simply learn something new. This website will help me remember the commands and vocab. I learned that building a website is like building a house. HTML is like the frame of the house. Then CSS is the color and style for the house. Lastly, JavaScript makes the house interactive.

One of the uses for this website is that you can use it to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. These notes only scratch the surface. You can interact with the website by opening DevTools console. It shows a list of topics that we learned from the prework and chooses one topic for you to study.
